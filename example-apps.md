# OSAi Example Applications

## 1. Smart Flask Development Environment

### Self-Monitoring Flask App
```python
from flask import Flask
from osai.monitor import intelligent_monitor

app = Flask(__name__)
monitor = intelligent_monitor(app)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

OSAi Output:
```
Monitoring Flask application...
✓ Route handlers optimized for current load
✓ Database connections self-tuning
✓ Static file serving automatically configured
! Performance warning: home route could be cached
  → Applied automatic caching
```

### Features Demonstrated
- Automatic performance optimization
- Self-tuning database connections
- Intelligent route handling
- Automatic caching decisions
- Real-time adaptation

## 2. Intelligent API Service

### Self-Healing REST API
```python
from flask import Flask
from osai.api import smart_api
from osai.database import intelligent_db

app = Flask(__name__)
api = smart_api(app)
db = intelligent_db()

@api.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    return db.query('users')
```

OSAi Features:
- Automatic query optimization
- Self-scaling endpoints
- Request pattern learning
- Automatic error recovery
- Performance self-tuning

## 3. Development Assistant

### Interactive Development
```bash
# Start development with OSAi
osai-monitor "watch and assist flask development"

> Creating new endpoint /users...
> OSAi: I notice you're accessing the database
  Recommended: Add connection pooling
  Applying optimal configuration...
  Added error handling...
  Implemented rate limiting...
  
> Modifying user authentication...
> OSAi: Security implications detected
  Adding CSRF protection...
  Updating session handling...
  Implementing request validation...
```

### Features Shown
- Real-time development assistance
- Automatic security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Best practice enforcement

## 4. System Integration Demo

### Microservices Monitor
```python
from flask import Flask
from osai.services import service_monitor

app = Flask(__name__)
monitor = service_monitor([
    'auth_service',
    'user_service',
    'payment_service'
])

@app.route('/status')
def status():
    return monitor.health_check()
```

OSAi Capabilities:
- Service health monitoring
- Automatic scaling
- Inter-service optimization
- Resource balancing
- Self-healing connections

## 5. Database Intelligence

### Smart Data Handler
```python
from osai.database import SmartDB

db = SmartDB('postgresql://localhost/myapp')

# OSAi automatically:
# - Optimizes queries
# - Manages connections
# - Handles migrations
# - Balances loads
# - Prevents issues
```

Features:
- Query optimization
- Schema management
- Performance tuning
- Automatic indexing
- Problem prevention

## Running the Examples

1. Install OSAi:
```bash
pip install osai-monitor
```

2. Start monitoring:
```bash
osai-monitor "watch flask app.py"
```

3. See intelligence in action:
```bash
OSAi: Monitoring Flask application...
- Detected optimal database configuration
- Applied security best practices
- Optimized static file serving
- Implemented caching strategy
```

## What These Examples Show

1. Development Intelligence
- Real-time assistance
- Automatic optimization
- Security enforcement
- Best practice implementation

2. Operational Intelligence
- Self-monitoring
- Automatic scaling
- Problem prevention
- Performance optimization

3. System Understanding
- Component relationships
- Resource usage patterns
- Security implications
- Performance bottlenecks

These examples demonstrate how OSAi transforms development from manual configuration and debugging into an intelligent, self-managing process. They show the power of having AI native to the system rather than just as an add-on tool.

## Next Steps

After trying these examples, users can:
1. Integrate OSAi into existing projects
2. Explore more advanced features
3. Contribute to the project
4. Build custom intelligence modules

These examples provide a clear path from concept to implementation, showing how OSAi makes development more efficient and systems more reliable.
