## Vision

OSAi reimagines what an operating system could be if AI was native to every component. Instead of AI running ON the system, intelligence is IN the system - every file, process, and component understands its purpose and can adapt intelligently.

### Current Features

- üß† **Natural Language Control**: Interact with your system using plain English
- üìä **Intelligent Monitoring**: Self-aware process and file monitoring
- üîÑ **Self-Healing**: Components that understand and fix themselves
- üöÄ **Development Assistance**: AI-native development tools

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install OSAi monitor
npm install -g osai-monitor

# Start monitoring with natural language
osai-monitor "watch and optimize my flask app"

# Monitor process behavior
osai-process "analyze what process 1234 is doing"
```

## Example: Flask Development

```python
from flask import Flask
from osai.flask import monitor

app = Flask(__name__)
monitor(app)  # OSAi now manages your app intelligently

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello World"
```

OSAi will:
- Monitor performance
- Suggest improvements
- Fix issues automatically
- Optimize for your environment

## Why OSAi?

Traditional OS:
```
Error: Memory leak detected
* Manual debugging required
* Stack traces to analyze
* Configuration to adjust
* System to restart
```

With OSAi:
```
OSAi: "Memory leak detected in process 1234
- Identified cause: Unclosed database connections
- Implementing automatic connection pooling
- Optimizing resource cleanup
‚úì Issue resolved, monitoring for stability"
```
